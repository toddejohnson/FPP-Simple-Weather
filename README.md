# Simple-Weather
This will allow you to display the weather at a specified location on any of your Pixel Overlay models. Typically this will be a matrix or other high density prop.
No other Plugin is required.
The Simple Weather can also send the message to a different FPP device and that device does not need the plugin installed.
